<h2>Level 2</h2> <p> The goal of level 2 is to explore what is possible with the tetris interface</p> <p> We assume no prior programming knowledge</p> %% 0010000 % config_1
<h2>The Tetris board</h2> <p> The tetris board is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks deep. % @length = 20;@width = 10; @@
<h2>Getting the current piece</h2> <p> To get the current piece call function world.getCurrentPiece() and to get the current grid call world.getCurrentGrid(); %@grid = world.getCurrentGrid();@piece = world.getCurrentPiece();@@
<h2>Using the grid </h2> <p> The grid is represented by a multi dimensional array. To get the value at the 2nd column and the 4th row from the bottom you would call grid[1][3]. The indexes are 1 less that you might expect because arrayss are counted from 0. %@grid_value = grid[1][3];@@
<h2>Using the pieces</h2> <p> there are a number of actions that you can perform on each piece..  <ul> <li>world.moveRight(x)</li><li>world.moveLeft(x)</li><li>world.dropPiece()</li></ul> In each case x is the number of squares to move in the given direction %@@world.moveRight(2);@world.moveLeft(2);@world.dropPiece();@@
<h2>Get the board offsets</h2> <p> It is possible to get the x and y offset. Y corresponds to the number of empty columns between left border and the piece. X corresponds to the number of empty rows between top border and the piece.<ul><li>world.getYoffset(x)</li><li>world.getYoffset(x)</li></ul> % @@y_off = world.getYoffset();@x_off = world.getXoffset();@@
<h2>This is the end of level 2. You have been introduced to what you can do in the world of tetris! Now try writing some code to move the tetris pieces around the board using the X and Y offsets.
