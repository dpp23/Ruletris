<h2>Level 1</h2> <p> The goal of level 1 is to introduce you to some basic programming principles.  % % 0010000 % config_1
<h2>Variables</h2> <p> A variable is a value that can be change. A variable can either be: <ul> <li>integer : any whole number</li><li>boolean : True or False</li><li>String : a series of characters between " "</li></ul></p> % @ @ int number = 4 @ @ String some_text = "This is some text" @ @ boolean yes_or_no = true
<h2>Operators</h2> <p> An integer can be added (+), subtracted (-), multiplied (*) and divided (/). Dividing an integer will result in number that is rounded down to the nearest integer whole number.
<h2>Functions</h2> <p> A function is a block of code that you can define once but then use many times by simply writing the function name in your code. An example function that adds two numbers has been added to the editor.  </p> % @int add(int a, int b) @{@   return a + b;@}@@ % 
<h2>for loops</h2> <p> One of the most important programming commands is the for loop. it is declared like such: for(int i = 0; i<x ; i++) { expression_2 } <p> What this is saying is that we are going to declare a new integer variable i which we are going to set to zero. Whilst the value of i is less than the value of x we are going to execute expression_2. After every execution of the expression we are going to add 1 to the value of i. We then make the i<x comparrison again until the condition is not met.
