<h2>Level 4</h2> <p> The goal of level 4 is to introduce some more advanced functionality to allow our robot to start filling more complicated holes.</p> <p> This tutorial will lead you through all the steps necessary to achieve this with not prior programming knowledge! </p> %% 0010000 % config_1
<h2>Rotating the piece</h2> <p> By calling world.rotatePiece(n) where n is the number of clockwise rotations it is possible to rotate the piece. %@@world.rotatePiece();@@
<h2>Getting the next piece</h2> <p> In a game of tetris you will be presented with a random piece every turn. It is possible to queary the tetris board to determine the next piece. You can use this information to optimise your algorithm. You must call world.getCurrentPiece().%@new_piece = world.getNextPiece();@@
