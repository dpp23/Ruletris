<h2>Level 3</h2> <p> The goal of level 3 is to try and start putting together a programme to play Tetris using only square blocks. It should be able to fill in square holes anywhere on the game board. </p> <p> This tutorial will lead you through all the steps necessary to achieve this! </p> %% 0010000 % config_1
<h2>Finding the width of the piece</h2> <p> The various pieces have different lengths. This will effect what you can ant cant do to them. Code to find the length has just been added to your editor. % int getLength(int[][] piece) {@    for(int i=3; i>=0; i--) {@        boolean populated = false;@        for(int j=0; j<4; j++)@            if(piece[i][j] == 1) populated = true;@         if(populated) return i+1;@         }@     return 0;@ }
<h2>Finding the height of the piece</h2> <p> Use the width function to write a similar function to determine the height of each piece % 
<h2>Checking if we are allowed to move piece</h2> <p> It is very important that you check to see if you are allowed to move a piece where you want to move it before you actually do. The function added checks if a piece is allowed to be moved. %  @@boolean allowed (int x, int y) {@    if(x+pieceLength > length) return false;@    if(y+pieceWidth > width) return false;@    for(int i=0; i<pieceLength; i++)@        for(int j=0; j<pieceWidth; j++)@            if(piece[i][j] == 1 && grid[x+i][y+j] == 1) return false;@    return true;@}
<h2>Finding the biggest hole at the bottom of the grid</h2> <p> We are now going to try and find the biggest hole at the bottom of the grid. We do this be setting the maximum to 0 and then trying to find the biggest gap from the top of the board to the highest block in a given column. Try and figure out what the code does and add in the last few lines of code to the programme to make your first baisc tetris solver!%@@@max = 0;@best = 0;@for(int i=0; i<width; i++) {@    j=0;@    while(allowed(j,i)) j++;@    j--;@    if(j>max)@{        max = j;@        best = i;@        }@    }@@@
